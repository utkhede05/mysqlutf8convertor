This will be help for hosting script installation like Fantastico. Fantastico install with Latin Encoding and this code can covert to UTF-8.
Now I can convert Zawgyi Latin Encoding To Zawgyi UTF8 Encoding.

*What mean of Latin Encoding and UTF-8 Encoding ?*

Latin encode *က* is like *&#4096;* but UTF-8 encode just only က. So, Latin encoding may be use more spacing in database than UTF-8 encoding.

*What benefit of this code ?*

Most of the hosting panel conatain *Fantastico De Luxe* . It's easy to install wordpress, joomla,etc. But a problem is ,it is using Latin Base Database when installation the wordpress. Most of the myanmar people can't use this because of the Latin Base. Myanmar Character need UTF-8 encoding in Database.

So, you use this script and run easily.It's will convert all field to UTF-8 including database. Now, We use Fantastico De Luxe. After the install from Fantastico De Luxe , you need to run this script. You need to some requirement.
